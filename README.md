# README

This README explains how to use both assignment programs: Matrix and WiFi. Everything here is kept very basic.

## 1. Matrix Assignment

**What it does**  
– Reads a matrix (2D array) from input  
– Performs the required operations (e.g., addition, multiplication, transpose)  
– Prints the result to the screen

**Files**  
- `matrix.c` (or `matrix.py`): your source code  
- `input_matrix.txt` (optional): example input

**How to compile & run (C)**  
```bash
gcc matrix.c -o matrix
./matrix


WiFi RSSI Logger - Simple Readme
📱 App Purpose
A simple app that measures WiFi signal strength (RSSI) at different locations.

🛠️ How It Works
Select a location from the dropdown

Tap Scan to start measuring

The app automatically:

Scans nearby WiFi networks 100 times

Records signal strengths (RSSI values)

Shows min/max/average signal strength

🔑 Key Features
Measures WiFi signal strength in dBm

Supports 3 different locations

Auto-retries failed scans

Shows simple statistics

⚙️ Permissions Needed
Location access (required for WiFi scanning)

WiFi control permissions

📊 What It Measures
For each location, it calculates:

✅ Minimum signal strength

✅ Maximum signal strength

✅ Average signal strength

🏁 Getting Started
Just install and run - no setup needed! Make sure:

WiFi is turned on

Location permission is granted
